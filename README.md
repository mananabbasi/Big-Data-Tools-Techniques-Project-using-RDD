Cleaning the excell file using RDD and answering the question
client wishes to gain further insight into 
clinical trials. You are tasked with answering these questions, using visualisations where 
these would support your conclusions.
You should address the following questions. 
1. The number of studies in the dataset. You must ensure that you explicitly check 
distinct studies.
2. You should list all the types (as contained in the Type column) of studies in the 
dataset along with the frequencies of each type. These should be ordered from 
most frequent to least frequent.
3. The top 5 conditions (from Conditions) with their frequencies.
4. Find the 10 most common sponsors that are not pharmaceutical companies, along 
with the number of clinical trials they have sponsored. Hint: For a basic 
implementation, you can assume that the Parent Company column contains all 
possible pharmaceutical companies.
5. Plot number of completed studies for each month in 2023. You need to include your 
visualization as well as a table of all the values you have plotted for each month.
